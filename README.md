## Stretch

### Pick a different programming language from JavaScript (e.g. Ruby, Swift, Python, C, Javaâ€¦) and write tests & implementations for each.

- [ ] Can run all non-JavaScript tests with a single command.
- [ ] For each algorithm identified above, there exists:
- [ ] a test file with multiple unit tests for each algorithm in a language other than JavaScript.
- [ ] an implementation file with a correct implementation of the algorithm in a language other than JavaScript.
